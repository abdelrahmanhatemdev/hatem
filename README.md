# Hatem Portfolio

**Hatem.bio** is my personal portfolio website, built to professionally represent my work as a frontend developer. It highlights my projects, technical skills, and contact information in a clean, fast, and modern design.

## 📝 About the Project

This site serves as a central hub to showcase my experience building performant, responsive web applications using modern technologies. It’s optimized for performance, SEO, and accessibility — reflecting both my technical ability and attention to detail.

## 💡 Purpose

I developed this portfolio to present my frontend development capabilities in a structured and visually appealing way. The goal was to create a fast and elegant platform that not only showcases my work, but also demonstrates the same technologies and design principles I apply in real-world projects.
